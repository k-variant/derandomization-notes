\subsection*{The Upshot}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Hardness and randomness are tightly connected: hard functions can be
    used to design PRGs that stretch seeds of logarithmic length and fool small
    circuits. The quintisential construction of such a PRG is the
    Nisan-Wigderson (NW) PRG.
  \item The NW-PRG applies a hard function $f$ to many mostly disjoint
    projections (or subsequences) of the seed. The set of projections is given
    by a combinatorial design thats computable in polynomial time.
  \item The proof that the NW-PRG with a hard function $f$ yields a suitable
    PRG goes by contrapositive: if the PRG did not fool some circuit $D$, then we
    could \emph{reconstruct} from $D$ another small circuit that has small but
    significant agreement with $f$.
  \item A key technique in the above proof is the \emph{hybrid argument}, which
    states that if a circuit $D$ distinguishes the uniform distribution from
    another product distribution, then it distinguishes two ``hybrid'' product
    distributions that differ in a single coordinate.

\begin{definition}[Combinatorial design]
  A collection of subsets $T_1, \dots, T_m \subseteq [d]$ is a \emph{$(\ell, a)$-design}
	\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\card{S_i} = \ell$ for all $i$, and
		\item $\card{S_i \cap S_j} < a$ for all $i \ne j$.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
  \label{prop:design}
  Let $\eps \in (0, 1/2)$ and let $\ell, m \in \mathbb{N}$. There exists an
  $(\ell, a)$-design $T_1, \dots, T_m \subseteq [d]$ with $d = e^{2/\eps} \cdot
  \ell^2/a$ and $a = \eps \log{m}$. Moreover, this design can be found
  deterministically in time $\poly(m, d)$.
\end{proposition}

We will be interested in the parameter regime where $\eps$ is constant and $m =
2^\ell$. Then the proposition states that in time $O(2^\ell)$ we can find
$2^\ell$ sets from $[O(\ell)]$ that form an $(\ell, \eps \ell)$-design.

\comment{Add proof. The sketch is given in Problem 3.2 of Vadhan's pseudorandomness.}
